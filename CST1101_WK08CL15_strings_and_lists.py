# 1. You already know that double quotes can enclose strings
print()
q2s = "This string was in double quotes"
print(q2s)

# scaffolding follows to pause and wait for enter key
wait = input("Hit enter to continue\n")



# 2. You also know that single quotes can enclose strings
q1s = 'This string was in single quotes'
print(q1s)

# scaffolding follows to pause and wait for enter key
wait = input("Hit enter to continue\n")



# 3. And you know how to concatenate strings together
qs = "These are concatenated: " + q2s + "\n" + q1s
print(qs)

# scaffolding follows to pause and wait for enter key
wait = input("Hit enter to continue\n")



# 4. Did you know that you can use a docstring in an assignment? 
ds = """This string is made up of several lines of text
which were enclosed in triple quotes as a docstring"""
print(ds)


# scaffolding follows to pause and wait for enter key

# 5. Now that you have created some strings
#    Let's work with them as lists of characters
"""Lists are ordered sets of values also called elements.
Each value in a list is an element of that list.
Elements can be referenced by an index number.
Index numbers begin with zero and increase from left to right.
Index numbers are indicated inside square brackets []
immediately following the object name of the list."""

# Try to reference the element which is 'h' in q2s

# Try to reference the element which is 'a' in q1s

# Try to reference the element which is 'v; in ds


"""More than one element in a list can be referenced by
using the index number of the starting element, a colon, 
then the index number after the last element's index
 -- such as list[0:4] for the first three elements"""

# Try to reference the substring 'made' in the list ds

# What is the value of the element in position 47 in the list ds?
